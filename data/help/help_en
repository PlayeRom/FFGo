INSTALLATION

This program requires no installation, just unpack the archive anywhere and
make sure that all software requirements are met before the first start. If
you need help for installing these dependencies, you may consult the guide in
docs/INSTALL. You have to make sure the dependencies are installed for the
Python interpreter that you are going to use to run FGo!.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING

Click "fgo" file in the main directory of the program, or run it in a console
with the "./fgo" or "python3 fgo" command.

Running FGo! in a console is recommended as it gives access to FlightGear and
TerraSync output messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURATION

In order to use FGo! you need to first set it up. Open preferences window
(in menu choose: Settings => Preferences) and fill in empty entry fields.
Filling the first three entries in "FlightGear settings" tab is necessary for
proper operation of the program - the rest is optional.

Tip: Hover mouse cursor over any option to see its description.

Changes in "FlightGear settings" tab are applied immediately after clicking on
"Save Settings" button, however changes in other tabs may require restarting
FGo! for them to be applied.

TIPS&TRICKS

* If airport data source was set to "Scenery", then information about
  airport's park positions may not be available until corresponding scenery
  is installed.

* You can start a flight from an aircraft carrier. In the middle panel click on
  current airport ICAO code (right under aircraft picture) and choose one from
  available ships. ICAO code will then change to selected ship's name,
  and will be highlighted blue to indicate that you're now in "carrier mode".
  Corresponding scenario will be selected automatically.
  To be able to choose airports again, you need to click on carrier name,
  and from pop-up list select "None".

* In "Select Scenario" list, you can right click on any scenario to see its
  description (if available).

* Window dimensions are saved when "Save&Quit" button is clicked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

* FGo! does not track if TerraSync has been actually closed before starting
  a new instance of it. If "TerraSync" checkbutton is unchecked and checked
  again in short period of time, "error binding to port 5501" message may be
  shown in a console. It indicates that old instance of TerraSync does not
  finished downloading data yet. In that case, wait until download is finished
  and check "TerraSync" checkbutton again.

  Note: TerraSync is already well integrated into reasonably recent FlightGear
        versions; therefore, you don't have to use this specific FGo! feature
        anymore in order to use TerraSync.

* Very long parking places names does not fit in parking button.
