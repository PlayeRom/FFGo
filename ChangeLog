in the file 'ChangeLog.FGo'.

******************************************************************************

1.0.0b2
[FEATURE] Import the code from FGo! 1.5.5 onwards (Python 2 at that time)
          into a Git repository. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Port the code to Python 3. (Robert)
[FEATURE] Add the file docs/INSTALL/INSTALL_en to guide users through the
          process of installing the dependencies. (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix typo in "help_it" file. (Philip Lacroix)
[FEATURE] Add conditional config based on CondConfigParser. This is
          documented for FGo! users in docs/README.conditional-config/.
          (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix logic behind the Reset button. (Robert)
[FEATURE] Add keyboard shortcuts for "Run FG" (Ctrl-f), "Reset" (Ctrl-r) and
          "Save & Quit" (Ctrl-q). (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Move the "FG is running..." message from the separate "info" window
          to the main window. (Florent Rougon)

    * The separate window was annoying, because when switching from a
    workspace with FlightGear on top and FGo! below, to another workspace and
    back to the initial workspace, the "FG is running..." little window
    appeared on top of FlightGear, which prevented the user from controlling
    it until he explicitely switched to FlightGear's window.

    * The "FG is running..." message is now displayed in red in FGo!'s main
    window (in a Label widget) instead of the separate InfoWindow. When
    FlightGear is not running, this message is replaced by a "Ready"
    indication in green.

    * This new behaviour allows to interact with FGo! while FlightGear is
    running, except for the things that rely on stuff started in
    App.startLoops(). Among others, it makes it possible to modify the
    configuration before the fgfs process is completely terminated. It would
    be possible to keep the loops running even after FlightGear has been
    started, but that would sacrifice a small amount of performance, for IMHO
    very little benefit. I prefer freeing the CPU as much as possible for
    FlightGear.

    * As a bonus, the new Label widget indicates the exit status of the last
    FlightGear run, or the signal number in case the fgfs process was
    terminated by a signal.

    * While FlightGear is running, the "Run FG" button is now greyed out.

[FEATURE] Add preview of FlightGear command. (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add FlightGear output window and log saving.
          (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Remove everything related to running a standalone TerraSync
          program in the background. As TerraSync has been integrated into
          FlightGear several years ago, this feature was probably more
          confusing than useful to users nowadays. (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Allow the command preview and FG output windows to be detached,
          reattached and hidden. Store their geometry when reattaching,
          closing them or choosing "Save & Quit" to be able to restore it when
          they are later shown again. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Improve initialization of locales and translations at application
          startup. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Change USER_DATA_DIR to ~/.ffgo on Unix, %APPDATA%/FFGo on Windows.
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] New dialogs at application startup to offer to copy FGo!'s config
          file to USER_DATA_DIR when this is safe, start with "factory
          defaults", or abort. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Rename the 'fgo' script to 'ffgo' in order to avoid confusing users
          concerning the FGo! program distributed by Robert Leda.
          (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Allow closing the Preferences window with the Escape key.
          (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Rename the 'Reset' button to 'Reload config', which is more
          self-explanatory in my opinion. Add a tooltip to this button that
          indicates the config file path. (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Add menu entries in the File menu to reload the config file and to
          run FlightGear. These entries show the new keyboard shortcuts.
[FEATURE] Help files: update installation instructions, add description of new
          features and add a tip about config file reloading.
          (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add top-level README.rst and move first sections of
          data/help/help_en to it. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Update data/config/config_en: slightly reorder, improve wording
          (IMHO), remove reference to now-invalid URL (list of callsigns in
          use), introduce new options, give hint about
          'fgfs --help --verbose'. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] New ffgo.svg icon and new thumbnail.jpg (with xcf source).
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add Makefiles to automate generation of many files
          (messages.pot, *.po and *.mo files, ffgo.png in all sizes from
          ffgo.svg, HTML rendering of docs/README.conditional-config.source,
          release tarball...). (Florent Rougon)
