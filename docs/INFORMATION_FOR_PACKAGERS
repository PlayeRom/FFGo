INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS

= Location =
The FGo! release package can be extracted anywhere and the program can be run
from that location without having to move files around. For example, FGo! can
be installed to a specific user's home directory, and that user will be able
to run it right away, provided that the needed dependencies are installed.
For system-wide installations of FGo! it is recommended to copy the main fgo/
directory, with its entire content, to /opt, then create a symlink to the
application's executable in a location included in the PATH environment
variable, most likely /usr/bin. Optionally, a symlink to the configuration
file can be created as well in /etc.

= Documentation =
The program's documentation is stored in fgo/docs and can be either symlinked
from /usr/doc/fgo-x.y.z, or copied there.

= Icons =
Icons are stored in fgo/share/icons and can be either symlinked from or copied
to the proper directories in /usr/share/icons.

= Desktop =
A desktop file, fgo.desktop, is available in fgo/share. It creates a menu entry
for FGo! and simplifies the creation of application launchers. It can be either
symlinked from or copied to /usr/share/applications and expects the FGo!
executable to be available through $PATH, as well as icons to be in the right
place.

= Presets =
The default FGo! settings are quite minimal and the user is required to perform
a few minor tasks, like setting the needed paths for FlightGear executables and
directories. However, a presets file is available in fgo/data/config, which can
be used to specify settings that the packager wants to be enabled by default.
For example, in a system-wide installation this will allow every user to run
FGo! without having to bother with its basic setup; other FGo! and FlightGear
options can also be specified. The presets file is well commented and will be
used by FGo! every time a local ~/.fgo/config cannot be found: for instance,
this is the case when FGo! is run by the user for the first time.
